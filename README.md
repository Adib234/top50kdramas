### Project

This is my first time using Scrapy, I had also scraped the top 50 Korean dramas from Wikipedia using BeautifulSoup but it was annoying because I didn't know how to exactly target the HTML. With Scrapy and the power of XPaths, it made my life really easy. Bonus, I also converted this with one command to a JSON file!

### Next Steps

In the future I would really like to leverage this tool to create an Korean drama API that accesess certain information. I'm currently learning how to build Flask APIs.
